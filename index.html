            <h3>What is the Transport Layer (OSI)</h3>
            <hr>The transport layer is the fourth layer in the open systems interconnection (OSI) network model.

           <p>The transport layer's tasks include error correction as well as segmenting and desegmenting data before and after it's transported across the network. This layer is also responsible for flow control and making sure that segmented data is delivered over the network in the correct sequence.<p>
<p>This layer works transparently within the layers above to deliver and receive data without errors.<p>
<p>It breaks application messages into segments (packets) and passes them on to the network layer<p>
<div>The receiving side then reassembles segments into messages and passes them to the application layer </div>

            <h3>How does this layer relate to the TCP/IP model? </h3>
        </br>
          <p>
            TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) manages how a message is broken down to be transmitted. IP (Internet Protocol) defines how to address and route packets to be delivered
