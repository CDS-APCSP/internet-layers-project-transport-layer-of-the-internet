# internet-layers-project

## Instructions
You will be working with a partner on this assignment. You and your partner will be working on the code together. You can both work on the same computer or work from different computers and push your changes as a group. Let me know if you need help with this. Your group should upload your changes to the website and make it live with Github Pages for submission.

## Coding Content 
You and your partner must change and/or add the following items on your website
-title
-headings
-add images (at least 2)
-change background color
-change font color

## Reading Content
You and your partner will be given a topic to research. You will be researching the [OSI Model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) of the Internet. The 7 layers of the OSI Model are:
-Application Layer
-Presentation Layer
-Session Layer
-Transport Layer
-Network Layer
-Data Link Layer
-Physical Layer

In class, we used the [TCP/IP Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) of the Internet for class dicussions. Your group must explain where your 'layer' fits in with what we discussed in class. So you will take one of the layers from the OSI Model and explain the protocols that are used and where it can be found in the TCP/IP Model.
